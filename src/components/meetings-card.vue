    This year it was imperative for the IASLC to execute impactful and
    interactive virtual conferences, given the continued, serious public health
    concerns and restrictions on travel and in-person gatherings due to
    COVID-19. As a result, the IASLC executed a portfolio of six fully virtual
    conferences with pre-recorded, live, and on-demand content. The WCLC 2021
    offered Meet the Expert sessions and Brain Exchange sessions, offering the
    opportunity for greater interactivity, engagement, and member connectivity
    in a virtual setting.
